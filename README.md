### Different features and functionalities of my website:

1. In this project, employees face role-based registration. Employees input
   their email, password, and details such as bank account number, salary,
   designation, and upload their photo. Only registered employees can log in.

2. Only registered employees can access the dashboard. The dashboard menu is
   decorated based on the employee's role. If the employee is an admin,
   admin-related routes are displayed; if an HR, HR-related routes are shown,
   and if only an employee, employee-related routes are visible.

3. In the HR route, HR can view all employee information in a table. HR can
   verify employees and pay the salary of verified employees. If the employee is
   verified, clicking the pay button opens a modal for HR to process the salary
   payment. The table also includes a details button to view a user-specific
   profile and a bar chart based on their salary. The HR route also displays all
   submitted work in the progress page.

4. In the Employee Route, employees can see the monthly history of their salary
   in a table. The earliest month's salary is displayed in the first row,
   followed by payment information for past months. In the Work Sheet route,
   employees can add and view submitted work data in a table.

5. In the Admin Route, admins can view all verified employees in a table. Admins
   can promote employees to HR and terminate employment. If an employee is
   fired, the fired button is displayed.
